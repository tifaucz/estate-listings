## Architecture
- Using Svelte for it's performance and ease of use.

- Tailwind for it's simplicity and organization when styling components.
- Other than that, a very simple structure due to the project's limited scope.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd estate-listings
npm install
```

...then start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can serve up the newly built app with `npm run preview`. This allows you to ensure nothing was damaged in the production build process.

You can then host the app with whichever static host you prefer.
